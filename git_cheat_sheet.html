  <h2>Creating a Repository</h2>
    <p>If you want to create a repository of a project, place all the files if the project in the same folder. In you console, make this file your working directory. Once you are in that directory type:<br><br>
    <code>$ git init</code><br><br>
    You'll see a message saying that a repository was created in your folder
    </p>

  <h2>Linking you local repository to GitHub</h2>
    <p>if you want to link your local repository to a remote repo, first you have to create your remote repository in GitHub. Then you can type in your terminal<br><br>
    <code>$ git remote add origin http://github.com/username/repository_name</code><br><br>
    </p>

  <h2>Adding files to the staging area</h2>
    <p>If you want to Git to keep track of a file, you need to add it to the staging area. To accomplish that, type:<br><br>
    <code>$ git add filename</code><br><br>
    Also you can add all the files in your folder typing<br><br>
    <code>$ git add .</code><br><br>
    </p>

  <h2>Commit to a repository</h2>
    <p>A commit is like a snapshop of the files you have in the staging area in a particular moment. In order to commit to your local repository type:<br><br>
    <code>$ git commit -m "Message"</code><br><br>
    Remember you have to add the files to the staging area everytime you want to do a commit. There's an option to commit adding all the files to the staging area<br><br>
    <code>$ git commit -a -m "Message"</code><br><br>
    </p>

  <h2>Status and log</h2>
    <p>Anytime you can check the status and git log<br><br>
    <code>$ git status</code><br><br>
    The status will tell you in which branch are you in and if there's any chango to commit.<br>
    The git log command will display all the commits for your repository in the current branch you are
    <br><br>
    <code>$ git log</code><br><br>
    You'll see a list of all the commits you've made
    </p>

  <h2>Go back in time</h2>
    <p>You can check the status of you code in a previous state (a previous commit) with the checkout command<br><br>
    <code>$ git chechout 234ebc2345</code><br><br>
    If you look at your files, the will look like they were in the moments you committed to you repo.<br>
    if you wan to go back to the last state type
    <br><br>
    <code>$ git checkout master</code><br><br>
    </p>
